# EWAS-QC

Extensive preprocessing into EWAS data to address various potential issues, including sample quality, probe reliability, and genetic ancestry. Initial quality assessments ensured that only samples meeting stringent criteria were included, thereby minimizing the risk of bias from low-quality data. Probe filtering was applied to retain only those probes that provided reliable measurements of DNAm. Ancestry filtering was employed to reduce confounding effects arising from population stratification, ensuring that observed associations were not artifacts of genetic background.

Here is the main workflow followed in this analysis:
